# NextJS, Eslint, and Prettier Setup Guide

While [NextJS's documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint) does mention Eslint and Prettier, it doesn't provide a thorough guide for a fully operational setup. This comprehensive repository is created to fill this void by presenting an easily followable guide. 

## Utilizing this Repository

To comprehend Eslint and Prettier setup, you may trace each commit. The sequence indicating their respective setup is listed below:

1. Initial creation via Create Next App
2. Turn on the Eslint strict mode.
3. Add eslint:recommended.
4. Set up [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) precommit hook.
5. Addition of prettier configuration

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) initiative created with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
